What problem does your project hope to tackle? How will your final product help to solve this problem? How will the target audience you specified above benefit from your app?
(Answer with a minimum of 200 words)

The problem this project aims to tackle is the lack of a modern beginner-friendly, 
local multiplayer racing game that is focused on 1v1 split-screen gameplay rather than solo or online play.
Today, most racing games are very complex and realistic simulations that can be hard for casual players to 
wrap their heads around or are heavily focused on competitive online experiences that are similarly difficult
for someone new to racing games or playing casually to get into. This game is designed with a player who prefers
a simpler, "retro" couch co-op experience. It does this by throwing back the experience with elements like split-screen
and a retro soundtrack, while being fun and easy to pick up for beginners. 

The final product will hopefully be intuitive, and easy to control with a simple but engaging track layout with replayability. We aim to make a smooth and responsive control layout compatible both with KBM and a controller. The target audience is casual gamers, families, and friends who are looking for a local co-op game that is easy to pick up, void of advertisements or internet requirements, and offers an entertaining experience that encourages social interaction. We hope that in the right environment, this game can offer a nostalgic experience for long-time retro game fans and a fresh one for people who are into racing games. 


Identify the programming language(s) you will need to learn in order to work on this project. Provide a link to the official documentation for this programming language. Also, please provide 3 free, easy-to-access resources that you can use to learn this programming language.

The primary programming language used for this project is C# as its the standard language for writing scripts in Unity. Although we are not experienced in the language, we believe that this is a great opportunity to learn as it provides an object-oriented approach that is supposedly best suited for handling video game mechanics like player input and camera movement.

Identify the tools, frameworks, etc. you might need to learn in order to work on this project. Please provide a link to each.

Unity Game Engine: https://unity.com

Unity Version Control (Plastic SCM): Basically like Git for Unity

Blender (Maybe): If we have the time to go down the route of creating our own models rather than looking for assets, Blender is the moves!.
