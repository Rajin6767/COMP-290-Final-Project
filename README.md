# COMP-290-Final-Project
This is the Official readme for our COMP 290 Game Dev Final Project.

--- PROJECT PROPOSAL OUTLINE ---

**What type of project will you work on? Will it be a web app, mobile app, or something else?  What will your project do?**

For our COMP 290 final project, we will develop a simple split-screen car racing game using Unity and C#. This project will feature a single diverse track where two players can compete against each other in a local multiplayer setup. The game screen will be split in half, allowing both players to have their own view as they race. The game will focus on straightforward racing mechanics, with players controlling their cars using either a keyboard or a game controller. Instead of a lap-based system, the game will use a dynamic point-based scoring system. At the start of the race, each player will have a full score bar and as the race progresses, the player who falls behind will gradually lose points. The farther a player is behind their opponent, the faster they will lose points. The goal is to maintain the lead and deplete the opponent’s score. At the end of the track, the player with the higher score wins. The game will also include a simple main menu, start and finish lines, and a scoreboard to display the final results. This project aims to provide an enjoyable, competitive experience with easy-to-learn controls and mechanics, making it accessible for everyone.

**Why did you choose to work on this project? What motivates you to choose this topic?
(Answer with a minimum of 100 words)**

We decided to work on this project because we’ve always been interested in game development and wanted a chance to build something fun and creative. During a recent hackathon, we tried to create a game but quickly realized we had taken on too much. We struggled with the complexity and, in the end, couldn’t finish the project. Although it felt like a "failure," we actually enjoyed the process and learned a lot from the experience. It made us want to try again, but with a simpler and more achievable idea. This time, we’re focusing on making a straightforward racing game that we can complete and polish. We’re excited to apply what we learned from our earlier attempt and finally create a game we can be proud of. It’s a great opportunity for us to explore new skills, have fun, and prove to ourselves that we can successfully finish what we started.



**Who is the target audience of this app? Be specific about the demographic (age / occupation), the type of devices they might use (computer, Apple phone, smartwatch, etc).
(Answer with a minimum of 200 words)**

The target audience for our racing game includes people of all ages who are looking for a simple, casual racing experience without the stress of highly competitive games. Due to its straightforward mechanics and easy to learn controls, the game can cater to a wide range of players, from young children to older adults. It’s designed for those who prefer a laid-back gaming experience and don’t want to deal with complex features or online multiplayer setups. This game is intended for PC users as well as people who play with a controller, making it perfect for laptops and desktop computers. The focus on offline play means it can be enjoyed anywhere, without needing an internet connection. It’s ideal for casual gamers who want a quick and fun racing game to play alone or with a friend using local multiplayer. By keeping the gameplay simple and accessible, it offers something for players of all ages and skill levels, whether they’re kids trying their first racing game, teenagers looking for a fun game night activity, or adults who want a break from more complex titles. The game’s design aims to be inclusive and approachable, making it a great fit for anyone looking for a relaxing, enjoyable racing experience.



**What problem does your project hope to tackle? How will your final product help to solve this problem? How will the target audience you specified above benefit from your app?
(Answer with a minimum of 200 words)**

The problem this project aims to tackle is the lack of a modern beginner-friendly, 
local multiplayer racing game that is focused on 1v1 split-screen gameplay rather than solo or online play.
Today, most racing games are very complex and realistic simulations that can be hard for casual players to 
wrap their heads around or are heavily focused on competitive online experiences that are similarly difficult
for someone new to racing games or playing casually to get into. This game is designed with a player who prefers
a simpler, "retro" couch co-op experience. It does this by throwing back the experience with elements like split-screen
and a retro soundtrack, while being fun and easy to pick up for beginners. 

The final product will hopefully be intuitive, and easy to control with a simple but engaging track layout with replayability. We aim to make a smooth and responsive control layout compatible both with KBM and a controller. The target audience is casual gamers, families, and friends who are looking for a local co-op game that is easy to pick up, void of advertisements or internet requirements, and offers an entertaining experience that encourages social interaction. We hope that in the right environment, this game can offer a nostalgic experience for long-time retro game fans and a fresh one for people who are into racing games. 


**Identify the programming language(s) you will need to learn in order to work on this project. Provide a link to the official documentation for this programming language. Also, please provide 3 free, easy-to-access resources that you can use to learn this programming language.**

The primary programming language used for this project is C# as its the standard language for writing scripts in Unity. Although we are not experienced in the language, we believe that this is a great opportunity to learn as it provides an object-oriented approach that is supposedly best suited for handling video game mechanics like player input and camera movement.

Unity Version Control (Plastic SCM): Basically like Git for Unity

Blender (Maybe): If we have the time to go down the route of creating our own models rather than looking for assets, Blender is the moves!.

This link will take you to 2 frames of wireframed templates for our racing game. As the concept is still in an early development stage its pretty primitive, but I think it gets te main components of the game down!
